One thing I often do is copy some text with y and select some text in visual mode followed by using p or P to replace it with what I have just copied.

However what really annoys me is that every time after I press p or P , the content(ie. visual selection) being replaced is saved to the top of kill-ring which ruined my next paste operation with p or P since kill-ring has been changed.

This fixes that.
